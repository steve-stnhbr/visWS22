## Framework Description

This framework uses three.js and d3.js for volume rendering and setting the appearance, respectively. 
The following files are provided: 
* **index.html**: contains the HTML content. Please enter your names! Otherwise, it does not need to be changed 
(but can be, if required). 
* **style.css**: CSS styles (can be adjusted, but do not need to be changed). 
* **three.js/build/three.js**: Contains the three.js library. **Do not modify!**
* **shaders**: Folder containing a dummy vertex and fragment shader. **Add your shaders to this folder!** 
* **js**: Folder containing all JavaScript files. **Add new classes as separate js-files in this folder!** 
    * **vis1.js**: Main script file. TODOs for students can be found there. Needs to be modified. 
    * **shader.js**: Base shader class. Does not need to be modified. Derive your custom shader materials from this class!
    * **testShader.js**: Example shader class demonstrating how to create and use a shader material 
    using external .essl files. Should not be used in the final submission.  
    * **fbo.js**: Frame buffer object class for convenience. Does not need to be modified. 
    * **camera.js**: Simple orbit camera that moves nicely around our volumes. Does not need to be modified. 
    
Created 2021 by Manuela Waldner, Diana Schalko, amd Laura Luidolt based on the Vis1 Task 1 Qt framework 
initially created by Johanna Schmidt, Tobias Klein, and Laura Luidolt. 

## JavaScript

Javascript files should go to folder 'js' and end with '.js'. All new javascript files have to be included in index.html. 

Recommended IDE: Webstorm (free educational version available using TU Wien e-mail address)

*Important*: do not run index.html from the file system! Only execute it from inside WebStorm 
(by selecting a browser icon from the top right panel that appears when you open index.html) 
or from hosting the project within another web server. Opening index.html directly in the browser without a server
will result in an error when trying to load the the .essl shader files. 


## Shaders

.essl is the OpenGL ES shading language. Shader files should all be located in the folder 'shaders' and end with '.essl'.  

Recommended code editor: Visual Studio Code (free): https://code.visualstudio.com/

Install syntax highlighting for shading languages: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=slevesque.shader

Enable syntax highlighting: open shader file --> in the blue bar on the bottom, switch from plain text to GLSL
